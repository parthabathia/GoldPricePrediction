# Gold Price Prediction

This Python code performs a machine learning analysis on a dataset related to gold prices (`gold_dataset`). Here's a step-by-step description of the code:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   - `numpy`: Numerical operations library.
   - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
   - `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`: Data visualization libraries.
   - `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - `RandomForestRegressor` from `sklearn.ensemble`: Implements a random forest regression model.
   - `metrics` from `sklearn`: Provides performance metrics for evaluating the model.

2. **Loading and Exploring Data:**
   - Reads a CSV file (`gold.csv`) containing gold-related data into a Pandas DataFrame (`gold_dataset`).
   - Displays the first few rows of the dataset using `head()` and basic statistical information using `describe()`.

3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Calculates the correlation matrix for the features in the dataset (`correlation`).
   - Creates a heatmap using Seaborn to visualize the correlations between different features.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Plots a distribution plot (`distplot`) for the 'GLD' (gold) column.

5. **Data Preparation:**
   - Splits the dataset into features (`X`) and the target variable (`Y`).
   - Removes columns 'Date' and 'GLD' from the features as they are not used for prediction.

6. **Train-Test Split:**
   - Splits the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

7. **Random Forest Regression Model:**
   - Initializes a Random Forest Regressor model.
   - Fits the model to the training data.

8. **Model Evaluation - Training Set:**
   - Generates predictions (`X_train_prediction`) on the training set.
   - Calculates the R-squared score (`X_train_accuracy`) as a measure of model performance on the training set.

9. **Model Evaluation - Testing Set:**
   - Generates predictions (`X_test_prediction`) on the testing set.
   - Calculates the R-squared score (`X_test_accuracy`) and mean absolute error (`X_test_accuracy`) as measures of model performance on the testing set.

10. **Visualizing Results:**
    - Plots the actual values and predicted values for the testing set using a line plot.

This code essentially builds a Random Forest Regression model to predict gold prices based on the given features, evaluates its performance on both the training and testing sets, and visualizes the predicted values against the actual values.
